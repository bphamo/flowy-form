- if a db access call is new or needed, look in the `services` folder for any data access functions preexisting, if does not exist then add it
- always use functional programming and do not use classes
- always declare handlers in routes functions, as is Hono's best practices
- if common functions across multiple files needed, declare a new helper in `lib`
