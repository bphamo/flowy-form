- always use kebab-case for component casing.
- if a snippet is used twice, refactor component into `components` folder.
- if a snippet is static and does not use any data, refactor component into `components` folder.
- use common components whenever possible.
- always document common components, and add comments for how >300 lines components run.
- do not modify `routeTree.hen.ts`
